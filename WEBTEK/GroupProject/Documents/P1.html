            <h3>The client</h3>
            <p>
                The name of the client is the Caesar's Palace Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA. 
                The person that contacted us and asked for a website was Lance Armstrong, 
                which is the main stakeholder for the casino. We came in contact with mr. Armstrong through 
                one of the developers dad's, which were a part of the same cyckling team as mr. Armstrong.
                Mr. Armstrong is using the income from the casino to pay for his crimes with doping related lawsuits 
                that haunt him up to this date. It is therefore important to increase his personal income through 
                online services. The casino is one of the world's most famous and influential casinos in history, 
                and therefore wants to increase their position online as well.

        <div class="purpose">
            <h3>Purpose and goals</h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of the website is to draw in and gain customers for the Caesars Palace and its casino, 
                and furthermore to help Caesars palace make money and a larger profit. The site will accomplish this by 
                providing visitors with useful information, such as contact info and descriptions of the hotel/casino 
                and its services. The users will also be able to enroll to different tournaments and games such as Texas Hold'em poker,
                Blackjack, Dice and Roulette. The main goal will be to show all the different opportunities to the customers,
                and provide knowlegde on the different games and services available.

        <div class="audience">
            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>
                The intended audience is everyone of legal age who fancies a little bit of gambling, although the more 
                typical user might just be the middle-aged man with a bit too much time on their hands. They are going 
                to need a user-friendly and tidy website that allows them to go about their business in the most calm and 
                worry-free manner possible. We will make gambling appealing and profitable to the common user, which will 
                ensure large profits for the casino and mr. Armstrong himself.
