        <h2> 
            The changes:
        </h2>
        <p> 
            We have kept to our plan off making six easy to access pages, 
            but we have had some changes with html but especially with some of our javascript implementation. We also had
            some small changes in the general style off the website with some change in backround color and the banner.
            These changes are summarized below. 
        </p>

        
            <h3>Navigation structure</h3>
        <p> The navigation structure was changed after some consideration. The plan was to use a Caesar's palace logo for the homepage link, but we felt this 
            were a bit unclear for the user, and instead changed to a simple "hompepage" button. The logo/banner at the top of the page were also used as a homepage
            link for the user to navigate from any page, back to homepage. The initial plan was also to have a navbar where hovering revealed
            further links in a dropdown menu. This feature were also dropped since it was not necessary to reach the spesific content of the page.
        </p>

        
            <h3>Styling </h3>
        <p> Background-color was set to blanchedalmond (rgb(255, 235, 205)) <br>
            Navbar-hover-effect-color was set to gold (rgb(255, 215, 0)), the plan was also to make the links increase in size when hovered upon,
            but this feature were removed due to estethics. We also initially planned to make the navbar which had been selected silver,
            but we removed this effect due to estethics and the fact that the user can navigate to any page with only one click anyways <br>
            The background color of the logo picture on top of every page were set to dimgray (rgb(105, 105, 105)).


        </p>

      
            <h3>Contact page</h3>
        <p> The contact page has pretty muched stayed to the before-made plan. The page includes the hotels contact information
            as well as a FAQ part. In addition it features an email-system whih includes a couple javascript-features that werent
            planned before-hand. When submitting the form a javascript function is called which displays a div in the middle of the screen.
            Inside this div there is also an exit-button which also calls on a fucntion that removes the div again, aswell as reseting the form inputs.
            We decided to also add a picture on the page.
        </p>
       
            <h3>About page</h3>
        <p> The about page remains mostly the same, except for the pictures which we set to 30% widht instead of a certain amount 
            off pixels for responsive web design. we also made them with rounded edges to give the page a smoother feel. 
        </p>
       
            <h3>Games page</h3>
        <p> The games site fulfills the purpose we imagined, but with some changes to the javascript. 
            The plan was originally to show the game info within an expanding div when the pictures is hovered.
            We experienced a few difficulties with this, among other things the direction of the transitions
            (they automaticaly expanded towards the right, so the picture furthest to the right expanded outside of the page),
            and the transitions when the window is minimized. We chose to skip this part, and rather make the game information
            appear below the pictures when they are hovered.
        </p>

       
            <h3>Pictures page</h3>
        <p> The pictures.html page turned out nearly as planned. The planned view showed the next and previous pictures in the background of the 
            picture displayed. This feature were dropped for estethic purposes and the site now shows the current picture with no pictures in a transparent
            background. 
        </p>

            <h3>Services page</h3>
        <p>
            The Services.html page turned out almost as planned, but with some more pictures with links included in the page. The currency
            calculator were implemented as planned and the layout turned out as planned. 
        </p>

            <h3>Homepage</h3>
        <p>
            The homepage.html turned out as planned with the info and pictures where they were planned. The styling and fonts were also set as
            planned and there were no major changes to report.
        </p>

        <h2>Fulfillment</h2>
        <p>
            Ferdinand fulfilled his games-html requirement by developing a structured code that was easy to use with
            the javascript part of the games page. He also fulfilled his services-html requiremnts by writing the code so that the goals 
            for how the services-html page should look was met. The infrastructure built on the html page, made the javascript currency 
            calculator very easy to implement on the page.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Jonathan made the currency calculator currency.js. We did not have a spesific design in mind so we cant say the design was changed,
            but we did use the same currencies as we specified in P2. This fulfilled the reqiurements
        </p>

        <p>
            Johan created the slideshow.js and implemented this in the Pictures.html. The code fulfilled the Javascript requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
            Steffen implemented the navigation bar with both Javascript and CSS to ensure user friendly interaction and smooth navigation
            between the different pages with navbarScrolled.js. The Services.html were also done with help from Ferdinand. This fulfilled the reqiurements
        </p>

        <p>
            Daniel implemented the contact.html page with a user validation on the input form represented in the page. The contact page were also
            made responsive and fulfilled the reqiurements
        </p>

        <p>
            Kristian made the homepage.html along with the Javascript for the imagesize.js to fulfill his requirements.
        </p>

      
        
            <h2> Modularity</h2>
        <p> We handled modularity by having one main css document named Layout.css that every page uses. 
            We also have the navbar, footer and header that is defined in an external javascript file.
            Everyone was responsible for the layout.css, but Steffen was responsible for the navbar implementation.
        </p>
