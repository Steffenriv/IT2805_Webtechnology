1. Why do mobile phones usually ignore auto play on video elements?
    - Usually has to do with performance, as the mobile phone does not have the strong hardware as computers do.
    An important hardware that get's really affected is the battery as if it autoplays video elements it can run out
    of battery quicker. Which most users do not like.

2. What will the CSS snippet at the end of this section do if the visitor is browsing on a device with 320
x 568 resolution?
    - The css at the end simply won't work. As it is only set up for certain situations. Only when media query is true, which it very well could
    be in this situation as phones do work on media query. However the most notable, is that the width is min 768 px which is more than the device 
    width. This statement will therefore be handled and the css inside won't apply. As it does not meet the requirements which it sets.

3. Mention some of the advantages of having a single responsive website instead of dedicated versions
like m.til.no for mobile and til.no for desktop?
    -The advantages is that when you have a responsive website, it would be set up to work for all devices. Which would make workload
    on developers a lot easier when they only have to work on one website. Working on multiple dedicated websites is a lot harder, and
    can also be troublesome when meeting issues you don't meet elsewhere. Having a single website for all purposes is generally a good 
    practice, and would make for easier toll on development team. However it may lack in some areas as it would not be able to 
    achieve all the same functionalities as a single dedicated website would.
