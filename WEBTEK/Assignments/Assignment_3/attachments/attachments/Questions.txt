1. What is the difference between position: absolute and position: fixed?
    -Position fixed sets to position of an object at a certain point on the screen,
    which will not change even if scroll down or up on the site. Can also get in the way of
    text that is in the fixed texts way. 
    Absoulute however will set the position to a certain point on the website and stay there, which means 
    we can go up and down on the site. And it will stay in the same position. Example if we set position to absolute and bottom to 0
    on footer. it will be set at the bottom of the original size site. However if we go further down the orginal site, scrolling, we 
    will go past the footer point. Unlike fixed which will always stay on the screen no matter how far down or up we go.
2. With CSS3, how do we access the third element within another element?
    -We can use :third after declaring the element. Example for a class container in a div we can write, 
    div.container:third or for third element in only container we can write .container:third



     div {
      margin: 10px;
    }

    div.header{
      padding: 0px; 
      margin-left: 200px;
      margin-right: 200px;
      text-align: center;
    }

    div.box {
      margin-left: 200px;
      margin-right: 200px;
    }

    div.two {
      float: left;
      position: absolute;
      bottom: 65px;
    }

    div.five {
      float: right;
      text-align: center;
      position: absolute;
      bottom: 65px;
      margin-right: 200px;
    }

    div.three {
      float: right;
      margin-right: -50px;
      margin-left: 50px;
      margin-top: 20px;
      margin-bottom: 20px;
    }

    div.four {
      margin: auto;
      margin-top: 20px;
      margin-bottom: 20px;
      float: center;
    }
