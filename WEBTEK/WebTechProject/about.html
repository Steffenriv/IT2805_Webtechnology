            <p id="aboutCustomer1"> "If you ever go to Las Vegas, you must go see Emma, casino host, at Caesar's Palace! She is the best. She managed all the trip details for a group of 20. We go back to Caesar's Palace every year because of her. Would not think of staying anywhere! Way to go, Emma! See you next year!"</p>
            <p id="aboutCustomer2"> We did not stay in the hotel but we did visit the casino and location. First of all, it is MASSIVE! It needs it's own zip code! We were very impressed with the decor of the entire property. Definitely a must-see while you're in Vegas! Be ready to walk!</p>
            <p id="aboutCustomer3"> I find they have the best poker room especially for tournaments. Staff is friendly as well as the players. They have 5 daily tournaments.</p>
