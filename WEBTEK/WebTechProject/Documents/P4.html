            Testing Document
        </h3>
        <p> 
            We used an online survey sheet for the feedback from testers. The online survey can be found at <a href="https://no.surveymonkey.com/r/3367D7C?fbclid=IwAR1640hUVZ7nxP-SkIqI6K7KLP31SMbDoIUB_icG-1_lCWHIchl1Sf0CmpQ"> 
            this URL </a>. The survey focuses on many important aspects of the website, and the questions included were the ones we were most 
            interested in feedback from potential users. 
        </p>
        <h4>
            Tester audience 
        </h4>

        <p> 
            Most of our testers were in the age range of 18-30 as they are one of the largest customer groups for Caesars Palace.
            The recruiting process was to consider succesfull: 87% of the testers where within the age range we seeked, and the
            remaining above the range. 50% of the testers were fellow students at NTNU, since this was the easiest and most
            available approach. The other testers was various contacts or friends of the development team.
        </p>
        
        <h4> 
            Testing Platforms
        </h4>
        <p>
            The testers used Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Safari and Samsung Internet while testing.
            PCs, MacBooks, mobile phones and tablets was all used during the testing.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Feedback summary
        </h4>
        <p>
            Most of the feedback we recieved was very postive. The design we built made the page very pleasing for the eyes,
            and embodied the energy and spirit of Cecars palace. A place where you socialize, escape from worries and stress, 
            and get a adrenaline rush to make money. We were also told that the usability of our page was very good,
            the average person will have no problem to use the website to achieve their specific goals. 
            The content on the page was also very good, and was written in a way that was very attractive for both humans and 
            search engines. We were also told that the website navigation was quite good, developed with the user in mind. It uses
            easy to understand language and links to the most important pages.
        </p>

        <p>
           On mobile devices the websites generally worked well and we heard good things about the design, but the navbar did not
           scale well and it led to people being unable to reach some off the websites on mobile 
           (if they didnt go through pictures because that appearently resized the navbar in a weird way), which is a huge issue.
           There was also some issues with the footer not resizing properly on mobile. 
           Some off these issues also appered when browsers got resized.
           Without the issues and especially on pc browsers we got largely a positive response on the navigation off the website and the
           style and functonalities off the website.
        </p>

        <p>
            A quick summary of the survey showed that the layout recieved a score of 4,3 out of 5. The functionality feedback were mainly 
            positive, and the accessability were also positive. Some constrictive feedback on font size and generalizing the text size and style, 
            which could have been done better. The overall compatibility were also good on computers. Some found a bug when clicking on the pictures.html
            site, which scaled the navbar a bit. This bug were not detected in the team on our computers, so we have not resolved the issue.
            Some users also commented on the navbar jumping when scrolling, this did not alter the functionality for the users,
            but could have been solved by the group. The mobile devices
            had some problems with rescaling the site down to a mobile screen, but the functionality were kept on an acceptable level. 

        </p>


        <h4> Our Response</h4>
        <p>
            We fixed most of the navbar and footer issues but we did not completely optimise the website for mobile, but if we were
            to continue the development off the website this would and should probably be a priority, as most people probably would access the website
            through their phone. This was a learning experience as we have worked on the website from computers it was natural for us to test with 
            computers, but we did not think enough about our end consumers. For example the games websites hover function is not great
            for mobile users so if we were to continue we would add a detection off touchscreen devices so the hover function could be a 
            click function instead for those users. We are greatful for the positive feedback on the design choices and 
            style of our website though.
        </p>
        <h3>Self reflection</h3>
        <p>
            The project went fine and we are glad we set such a strict time schedule because we met some unforseen delays so it was good
            to have extra time on our hands. Not only did we learn more about html, css and javascript but we also got to work alot
            more with Git. It made us a lot more confident in a group project for the future. The group dynamics have worked well and 
            everyone have fulfilled their tasks in a great way. The group agreed on meeting at least once a week to work together and to 
            resolve eachothers problems. The method also allowed the group to be social and created a fun and inspiring working environment.<br> <br>
            Finally we are still negotiating the final price for the work we have done for Caesars Palace, but we are certain that the 
            negotiations will pull through. We have enjoyed the work and are looking forward to future projects.
