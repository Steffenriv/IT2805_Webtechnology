        <br>
        <p>
            The purpose of the website is to draw in and gain customers for the Caesars Palace and 
            its casino, and furthermore to help Caesars palace make money and a larger profit. 
            The site will accomplish this by providing visitors with useful information, such as contact 
            info and descriptions of the hotel/casino and its services. The users will also be able to enroll 
            to different tournaments and games such as Texas Hold'em poker, Blackjack, Dice and Roulette. 
            The main goal will be to show all the different opportunities to the customers, and provide knowlegde 
            on the different games and services available.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The intended audience is everyone of legal age who fancies a little bit of gambling, 
            although the more typical user might just be the middle-aged man with a bit too much 
            time on their hands. They are going to need a user-friendly and tidy website that allows 
            them to go about their business in the most calm and worry-free manner possible. We will 
            make gambling appealing and profitable to the common user, which will ensure large profits 
            for the casino and mr. Armstrong himself.

        <p> <b>Figure 1:</b>  The navigation structure of the webpage, with clickable pathways illustrated</p>

        <p>
            The navigation bar will be visible at the top of the page on every page of the website, with in 
            total 6 clickable links. This will be the main navigation tool. In addition to this, a few of 
            the links will also reveal a drop-down menu when hovered upon. With this, all the different pages 
            will be linked to each other and can be reached with just one click, no matter what page you’re at. 
            For the homepage we will include a Caesars logo in the navbar that will work as the link to the homepage.
        </p>
        <p>
            The reason we chose this navigation structure is because it gives the user complete freedom to navigate 
            wherever they want. It is also a very basic and user-friendly structure.

        <br>
        <p>
            In coming up with the general design for the website we made sure the Caesars Palace 
            brand is easy to see and that the rest of the website is easy to navigate and understand 
            for the users. We have therefore focused on making a universal design that is simple and 
            clean, with a navigation bar the user can look at and immediately find what they are looking for. 
            The navigation bar will cover every topic the target audience will be interested in about the 
            Caesars casino. The games tab will be the most useful for everyone looking for information about 
            the games at Caesars Palace.

            There will be six different pages the user can access, and they will be the following:

                    <li>
                        The user will be welcomed by the home page, obviously.The goal of this page is to welcome the user 
                        and give a simple description of Caesar’s palace and the website. Therefore there will not be a lot 
                        of content on the home page, because we do not want to overwhelm the user.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At the top of the page Caesar’s logo along with the navigation bar will show. The navbar will as mentioned 
                        be fixed to the top of the screen. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Below the top section, the page will be dominated by a full scale picture of Ceasar’s palace, with the text 
                        “Welcome to Caesar’s palace” along with the mantra “Unleash your Caesar”, centered on top of the picture.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Below the picture there will be a simple yet fulfilling description of Caesar’s palace and what we have to offer.

                    to the homepage be about building the ceasars palace brand and will therefore have three pictures from inside the 
                    casino 250px by 250px. Under the pictures there will be some interviews from clientel at the casino.

                    <li>
                        We decided not to actually code the games on our game page, so the goal of this page will only be to achieve the 
                        objective of making people interested, and increase their desire to go and spend their money at the casino. 
                        The user will be seeing pictures of the games, and also the different rules of the games. There will also be 
                        provided a link, that would have taken the user to a new page where the user could have actually been able to 
                        play the different games that we listed.

                <p>
                    The picture.html page should be a relatively simple site including a gallery of all the pictures that Caesar’s 
                    palace has taken during the years. With some information about the event’s that are photographed. The page should 
                    also include a slideshow, which we will make in javascript. This slideshow should continue to swap pictures every 
                    10 seconds, or when the user clicks on the next or previous button, which will move them onto the next picture or 
                    go back to the previous picture. The buttons will be on the left and right side of the pictures, where previous is 
                    to the left and next is to the right.  As mentioned the pictures should also have a little text underneath, 
                    mentioning what happened, where it was taken and with who.
